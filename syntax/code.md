# Code Blocks

Pre-formatted code blocks are utilised for writing about programming or markup source code. Rather than a simple paragraph, the lines of a code block are interpreted litteraly.

Here is an example:

```
This is a code block
```
After creating a code block in Markdown, simply indent every line of the block with at least 4 spaces or 1 tab.

For example :

```
This is a normal paragraph:

    This is a code block.
```
You can also create a code block separated with:

    ``

### Inline code block

Inline code blocks can be written by using: `

For example:

    This is `an inline code block`

### Syntax highlighting

You can define the language utilised for syntax highlighting by adding a name on the opening tag. Example :

    ```js
    var a = {};
    ```
